# MongoDBName sets the name of the collection in MongoDB where everything editable is stored

# These are directories that contain preview .jpg images of an entire survey, broken into tiles
# Needed for DES, KiDS, S82... (DES is treated slightly differently, and can fetch tiles over the internet)
# For any other survey (KiDS, S82), the path pointed to should contain .jpg files for each tile,

# These directories contain .fits images, from which we will pull out cut outs of size plotSizeArcmin
# NOTE: for now, no spaces please in imageDirsLabels
# sizePix sets the size of the output .jpg image at the scale plotSizeArcmin (set above)
# minMaxRadiusArmin sets radius wrt source position within which min, max for image intensity scale is set
